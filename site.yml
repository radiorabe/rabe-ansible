# This is the master playbook. It includes all the other playbooks.
# Usually you would call it with a -t tagname to only run a specific tag
# over all machines.
#
# some common ones:
# TODO: non fedora examples
# -t fedmsgconfig -> runs fedmsg/base config over all playbooks
# -t apache -> run when tasks/apache.yml changes.
